Little Atari-like top down RPG, make your way through the dungeon, fight different kinds of enemies and defeat the boss. The game file is "v13usable.html", so called because it was the 13th iteration and because I bookmarked a few of the more playable/usable iterations throughout the process.

Controls: WASD to move, K to use the sword, L to use the shield.
Make sure to collect the chests above you at the beginning, they're where the sword and shield are. My high score is 4, in case you can find a way to beat it.
